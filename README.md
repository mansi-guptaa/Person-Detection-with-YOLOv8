This project demonstrates how to train an object detection model using YOLOv8 to identify persons in images.

## Problem Statement

The project aims to train an object detection model to identify persons. The problem revolves around developing a robust object detection solution, leveraging the capabilities of the YOLO framework and a curated dataset.

## Project Summary

* **Object Detection:** The task involves detecting persons in images.
* **Dataset Preparation:** The dataset was collected from online sources and annotated using LabelImg.
* **Model Training:** A YOLOv8 model is trained on the prepared dataset. The goal is to enable the model to accurately locate and classify persons in new, unseen images.
* **Model Evaluation and Prediction:** The trained model's performance is evaluated, and it is used to make predictions on new images.

## Steps Involved

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries like ultralytics.
2. **Data Preparation:** Annotate the dataset using LabelImg.
3. **Model Training:** Train a YOLOv8 model using the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model using provided metrics.
5. **Prediction:** Load the best trained model weights and use it to predict objects in new images.
